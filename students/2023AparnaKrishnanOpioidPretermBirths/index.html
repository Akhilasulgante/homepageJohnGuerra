  <h1>Project: The Effect of Opioid Exposure on Preterm Births in Oakland, California</h1>
  <h2>By Aparna Krishnan</h2>
  <h3>Supervised by <a href="http://johnguerra.co/">Dr. John Alexis Guerra Gomez</a></h3>

  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <p>The objective of this research project is to investigate the impact of opioid exposure on preterm births in Oakland, California. By analyzing data on opioid usage among pregnant women, we aim to understand the prevalence of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and its associated complications. The project will provide insights into the long-term implications of NAS and aid in the development of effective cessation programs and treatments for newborns affected by opioid exposure.</p>

  <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
  <p>The opioid crisis has had devastating effects on communities, including Oakland, California, which has been severely impacted by the epidemic. However, there is a lack of research on the specific effects of opioid usage on preterm babies and the prevalence of NAS in this population. This project aims to address this research gap by collecting and analyzing data from various sources, including city hospitals and rehabilitation centers, to shed light on the relationship between opioid exposure and preterm births. The findings will help in formulating evidence-based policies and interventions to mitigate the impact of the opioid crisis on the health of pregnant women and their infants in Oakland.</p>
