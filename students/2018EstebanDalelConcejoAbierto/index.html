                    Develop a tool for the Town Hall to keep political control over Bogota's Council. Automatize processes that are currently
                    done by hand. Make it public both as a product and as an API.

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>

                        Bogotá's government is divided into the Town Hall, led by the Mayor, and the Council, divided into three commissions. These
                        two entities have huge tensions between them because they must keep control over the other and function
                        independently. Currently, the Town Hall employs a big team to inform on any occurrence in the Council,
                        but this team has been lagging due to their poor system. At least one team member must be in every
                        session of the Council (which often happen on weekends and holidays) and take note of everything
                        in an Excel form created by the team, and then, through the livestream of the session, confirm that
                        all was properly written down. This information is then processed by a single engineer to be stored
                        in a single drive, creating a bottleneck and an obvious point of failure.

                    <p>
                        After several interviews with the team and stakeholders, deep data diving into the current datastore and design thinking
                        over the problem at hand, Concejo Abierto was born. Concejo Abierto aims to make this process much
                        less error prone by automatically processing the input and creating a system that not only the Town
                        Hall uses, but empowers citizens and researchers.
