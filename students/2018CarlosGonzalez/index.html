        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <div>
          According to the World Health Organization an estimated of 36 million people are blind and 217 million have some kind of visual impairment. For this population, access to digital images can be a challenge due to their disability.
          To overcome this problem, there are some techniques to represent a visual image on a tactile graphic that can be understood by blind people.
          However, the process of translating a visual image into a tactile graphic usually requires the intervention of a sighted person and the resulting image should be reviewed to determine its quality.
          The Teacher of the Visually Impaired (TVI) is the person responsible for accomplishing this task.
          Nevertheless, due to economic, social, or geographical circumstances, this role may be being exercised by parents, friends or teachers without adequate training and knowledge in tactile graphics.

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <div>
          1. A Machine Learning model capable of determine the quality, understood as the facility for a blind person to understand its content, of a tactile graphic.<br/>
          2. A custom Google search to help teachers of people with visual impairments, or anyone who plays their role, find good tactile graphics.<br/>
          3. A tool for users to test their own images.
