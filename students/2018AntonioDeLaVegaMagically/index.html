                Make the web more accessible by providing a easy-to-use repair and transformation tool that is targeted
                directly to non-technical users in order to circumvent the delay introduced by website owners.

            <div>
                Web accessibility is an important topic developers must take into account when creating applications.
                Having an accessible website means that people with disabilities will be able to use it regardless of
                their limitations. Furthermore, it is in the developer's best interest to provide accessible
                applications since 10-20% of the population of every country have some kind of disability. Indeed, a lot
                of effort has been placed throughout the years towards helping developers detect accessibility
                issues in their web applications. However, there is still room for growth in this area. Up until now,
                most users must wait for the owner of a website to provide accessible content. Depending on the
                individual or the company that's behind a website this may take a long time.

                1. Website that allows non-technical users to find and fix accessibility issues of other websites.
                <br/>
                2. Chrome extension that automatically fixes the accessibility issues as a user browses the web based
                on the projects made in the website described in point 1.
