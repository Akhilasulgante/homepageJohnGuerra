# John Alexis Guerra Gómez Home Page

A simple HTTP/CSS/JS page full of errors. Shows some of my projects, keeps my CV updated and tries to showcase all my students' great work

## Running

The page is mostly a static HTML page, with some javascript. To run it, just launch your favorite web server, e.g.:

```
cd homepageJohnGuerra
http-server
```

Some pages are written on JADE, so you might need the JADE compiler. However, the compiled HTML versions are included as well.
